- **Responsive grid layouts** for all screen sizes

## üìä Data Requirements

The AI components expect athlete data with the following structure:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  firstname: string,
  lastname: string,
  position: string,
  performance_score: number,
  fitness_level: string,
  injury_status: string,
  training_load: number,
  wellbeing_score: number,
  last_assessment: string,
  // ... other athlete properties
}
```

## üîß Customization

### Time Ranges
```jsx
// Development metrics with custom time range
<DevelopmentMetrics timeRange="12months" />

// Predictive analytics with custom horizon
<PredictiveAnalytics predictionHorizon="6months" />
```

### Action Handlers
```jsx
const handleAIAction = (insight) => {
  console.log('AI recommendation:', insight.title)
  // Implement custom action logic
}

<AIInsightsPanel onAction={handleAIAction} />
```
